# Audio Visualization and Synthesizer

This project combines a WebGL-based audio visualization with a dynamic, interactive keyboard. The audio visualization is driven by **Tone.js** and **Three.js**, providing real-time feedback based on audio frequencies. The keyboard features a one-octave range, with buttons to shift octaves up and down, and uses a polyphonic synthesizer for audio playback.

## Features

- **Audio Visualization**: Real-time frequency visualization using shaders.
- **Interactive Keyboard**: One-octave keyboard with clickable notes.
- **Octave Control**: Buttons to shift octaves up or down.
- **Polyphonic Synthesizer**: Play multiple notes simultaneously with a smooth release.
